hutos
-----
hutos is Hurd toolchain building scripts. 

Project webpage is at:

http://savannah.nongnu.org/projects/hutos


Build
-----
Create a setenv symbolic link file that points to the gcc-*-glibc-*.sh
file before you want to build it. For example:

	$ ln -sf gcc-4.1-glibc-2.7.sh setenv

To build the toolchain run:

	$ sh hurd-toolchain.sh

If you would like to build offline, download the relevant SOURCES
present in the gcc-*-glibc-*.sh and cross-gnu, cross-gnu-env scripts
in .tar.bz2 file format and put it in a tarballs directory.

or

$ sh hurd-toolchain.sh archive
will create tarballs of already downloaded sources for later use

Cleanup
-------
$ sh hurd-toolchain.sh clean
will remove _all_ the downloaded sources+builds. If you don't want to download
the sources again use the "archive" argument before cleaning up.

References
----------
The scripts are based on the Makefile written from:
