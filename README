hutos
-----
hutos is Hurd toolchain building scripts. 

Project webpage is at:

http://savannah.nongnu.org/projects/hutos

Build
-----

Create a setenv symbolic link file that points to the gcc-*-glibc-*.sh
file before you want to build it. For example:

	ln -sf gcc-4.1-glibc-2.7.sh setenv

To build the toolchain run:

	sh hurd-toolchain.sh

If you would like to build offline, download the relevant SOURCES
present in the gcc-*-glibc-*.sh and cross-gnu, cross-gnu-env scripts
in .tar.bz2 file format and put it in a tarballs directory.

References
----------

The scripts are based on the Makefile written from:
